# Topological-classification-of-a-directed-graph
Project implemeted for the course "Parallel Processing" during my 3rd year in CEID, UoP

## Project Description
In the framework of the exercise we will deal with the problem of topological classification of a directed graph, which finds application (among other things) in scheduling a sequence of tasks based on the dependencies that have between them.
